# Divvy Bikes Data Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive data visualization project focused on Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bike-sharing system. The project analyzes patterns in rider behavior, bike usage, trip durations, and station activity to uncover insights that can guide sustainable urban planning and operational improvements.

## ðŸš² Project Overview

The Divvy system plays a critical role in promoting eco-friendly transportation. This project leverages over 17 million trip records from 2021 to 2024 to explore:
- Seasonal and hourly ride trends
- Differences in usage between casual and member riders
- Popular stations and routes
- Ride duration patterns by user and bike type

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Identify key ridership trends from 2021â€“2024
- Compare behaviors of casual and member riders
- Analyze differences in usage by bike type and season
- Visualize station-level demand and route heatmaps
- Provide actionable insights for infrastructure and policy decisions

## ðŸ“Š Techniques Used

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Visualizations:** Line charts, heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts, rose plots, density maps  
- **Feature Engineering:** Hour-of-day, ride duration, temporal segments  
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Google Colab


## ðŸ“Œ Insights

- **Seasonality:** Summer shows peak ridership; winter the lowest
- **Time-of-day patterns:** Usage spikes during commute hours
- **Rider type behavior:** Members are consistent commuters; casual riders favor weekends and leisure
- **Bike preferences:** Classic bikes dominate, but electric bikes show growing use
- **Station hotspots:** Downtown and tourist zones see the highest density
